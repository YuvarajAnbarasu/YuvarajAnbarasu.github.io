							<span class="dsa"><center><img src="images/gsmst.jpeg" alt="" height="300" width="900"/></center></span>
							<br>
							<p>As a student at GSMST (Georgia School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology), my passion for STEM subjects drives my educational journey. Exploring the complexities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics brings me joy, and my time at GSMST has been an exciting learning experience, supported by educators and like-minded peers.</p>
							<p>STEM represents more than just subjects to me; it symbolizes a gateway to innovation and progress. I am eager to be part of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and technologists who can positively impact society. Beyond my studies, I actively participate in robotics competitions, science fairs, and clubs, applying my knowledge to real-world situations. Mentoring younger students and sharing my love for STEM are rewarding experiences.</p>
							<div style="justify-content: center; margin:50px;"><span class="dsa"><center><img src="images/robo.jpeg" alt="" height="300" width="300" style="border:2px solid black;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/tm.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="" style="border:2px solid black;"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/ma.png" alt="" height="300" width="300" style="border:2px solid black;"/></center></span></div>
							<p>Currently, I am actively involved in various clubs and organizations, holding multiple roles. I serve as the head coder of Robotics Team 675, organize the International Night event at GSMST, volunteer at Lilburn Tamil School, and tutor mathematics at Mathnasium. I plan to join and create more clubs and honor societies to spend my free time productively and work on additional projects beyond the listed ones. Clubs have nurtured my passion for STEM by offering opportunities to grow outside the traditional classroom setting.</p>
							<p>Volunteering is an essential part of my life, and I have already amassed over 100 hours of volunteer work. My goal is to achieve 300+ volunteer hours before graduating from high school. Additionally, I have explored various career paths through internships and job experiences, constantly seeking new opportunities to gain more expertise before committing to a specific career.</p>

							<p>My primary interests lie in Computer Science and Data Analytics, particularly Artificial Intelligence. I aspire to attend prestigious technology colleges like Georgia Institute of Technology or Carnegie Mellon to further develop my skills and dive deeper into my passion for AI and Computer Science.</p>
							<p>Looking ahead, I am dedicated to taking on new challenges, learning from diverse perspectives, and making a positive impact on the world through STEM. My free time is spent exploring scientific discoveries, working on technology projects, and participating in community outreach programs to promote STEM education. I am always eager to discuss the latest advancements in science and technology and explore how STEM can address real-world issues. I believe that by collaborating with others, we can create a brighter future together. As I set my sights on the future, I aim to join more extracurriculars, win competitions and awards, create innovative projects related to Computer Science, and excel academically. These endeavors will showcase my dedication and passion for STEM to colleges and future employers, establishing a benchmark for my journey in Computer Science.</p>
